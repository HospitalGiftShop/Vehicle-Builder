## Video on How to Use the Application

[Vehicle Builder Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xOepG3-qykH3d-ufmLGHrt_iERwK8wox/view?usp=sharing)

## Description

This is a TypeScript command line application that allows users to create / add vehicles such as Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes.  The user has the ability to choose from different prompts such as, creating or selecting from pre-defined vehicles, accelerate, decelerate, reverse, and more.  There are different actions that each vehicle type can do.

For the next updates, I will prevent a user from doing a wheelie or towing a vehicle unless the vehicle has been started.

## Installation

1. Open the command line and navigate to the location on your machine where you would like the application installed.
2. Clone the repository in your command line by entering: git clone <https://github.com/HospitalGiftShop/Vehicle-Builder.git>
3. Install Node.js (if not already installed).  Node.js will allow you to run the application directly in the command line. </br>
      [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en) </br>
      [Node.js Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
4. With Node installed, in the command line, enter: npm init -y.  This will initilize and create the package.json.
5. Use the command line to install the inquirer package by entering: npm i inquirer.

Optional:

You may also want to install and use a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to easily see the folder structure and make edits.

## Usage

In the command line, navigate (cd 'folder name') to the folder where the index.ts file is located.  While still in the command line type: node index.ts

You will be prompted with a series of actions to choose from and some actions are only relevant to certain vehicle types.  Once you are done with application, you can exit the actions by either selecting Exit or by select ctrl + c on your keyboard.
